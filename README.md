# Game Title

Welcome to **Game Title**! This is a brief document to help you get started with installing and running the game on your Ubuntu system.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the game, you'll need to install some necessary packages. This game requires SDL2 and other related libraries. Here's how you can install them:

### Installing Dependencies

Open your terminal and run the following commands to install the necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++ make libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev
```

This will install the C++ compiler, the make utility, and the SDL2 libraries needed to run the game.

## Downloading the Game

Clone the game repository or download the source code to your local machine. If the game is hosted on a repository (e.g., GitHub), you can clone it using:

```bash
git clone [URL_of_Game_Repository]
cd [Game_Directory]
```

Replace `[URL_of_Game_Repository]` with the actual URL of the game's repository and `[Game_Directory]` with the name of the directory that contains the game.

## Compilation

To compile the game, navigate to the game directory where the Makefile is located:

```bash
cd path/to/game
```

Then run the Make command:

```bash
make
```

This command will compile the game using the Makefile provided in the game directory.

## Running the Game

After compilation, you can run the game by executing:

```bash
./gameExecutableName
```

Replace `gameExecutableName` with the name of the executable created by the compilation process.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors during the installation of dependencies, compilation, or execution, please ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly, and the paths in the Makefile are set appropriately.

## Support

For additional help or to report issues, please reach out via the repository issues page or contact the support email provided.

### Customization Notes:

- **Game Title:** Replace **Game Title** with the name of your game.
- **[URL_of_Game_Repository]:** Replace this with the URL where your game's code is hosted.
- **[Game_Directory]:** Replace this with the actual directory name if it's necessary to navigate into it after cloning.
- **gameExecutableName:** Replace this with the actual executable name as defined in your Makefile.

This README template is quite simple and generic; you might need to add more specific instructions depending on the complexities and requirements of your game.
